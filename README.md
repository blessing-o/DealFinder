Project Title: 
DealFinder

Description: 
With the holiday season fast approaching our team decided we would assemble a website that can help shoppers make easy comparisons of highly sought after products.
Our website allows users to find products at various retailers with it's associated image, description, and price.
On the main page, users use a dropdown menu to select which retailer they would like to view products from. The user is then directed to a results page where the items from their chosen retailer are listed in a column.
